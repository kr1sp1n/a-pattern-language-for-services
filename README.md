# a-pattern-language-for-services
Heavy work in progress :smile:

Try to establish a pattern language that deals with service-oriented architectures.

Inspired by http://microservices.io/patterns/ and Christopher Alexander.

## application patterns

* Database architecture
  * shared database
  * database per service

* Security
  * authorization
  * authentication
    * multi-factor (MFA)
    * one-time password (OTP)

## application-infrastructure patterns

* Cross-cutting concerns
  * Service chassis
* Communication style
  * Messaging
  * RPC

## infrastructure patterns
